Jenâ€™s family has vacationed at Cape San Blas for many years; they love the area, and with a child who had developed an allergy to cold weather (yep, itâ€™s a thing) they decided to relocate from Indiana in 2007. Vicki is a military spouse; she and her family have moved all over the country. Her husband received an assignment to Tyndall AFB in 2006 and after exploring the surrounding area they chose PortÂ St. Joe as their new home.

Both of them know first-hand that after a long drive, the last thing you want to do is go grocery shopping; often there is no room for groceries with all of the other beach essentials. Thatâ€™s where we come in! Wouldnâ€™t you rather arrive to a fully stocked kitchen so you can start your vacation?
<h2>Why Bother?</h2>
If you have been to this area, you get it: The Forgotten Coast is exactly that. It has all of the charm of a true getaway but the grocery shopping options are limited, and are an average of twenty minutes away. Itâ€™s a double whammy â€“ you will spend half of your first full day at the store rather than the beach with every other vacationer attempting to do the same thing: frustrating. You came to RELAX!
